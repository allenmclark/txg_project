Background info for the 1d heat equation example

1d heat equation: du/dt = alpha * d^2u/dx^2

Boundary Conditions: 0 degrees at each end of bar (bar is insulated around middle)

1d copper bar: density density(rho) = 8.92 g/cm^3, specific heat(sigma) = 0.092 cal/gram degrees celcius, thermal conductivity(K) = .95 cal/cm sec degree celcius
